			<p>Did you know that Nintendo created some collectible Yoshi's revolving around this game's new yarn look? Three colored Yarn Yoshi Amiibo figures have been released in Green, Pink and Blue. You can also scan these Yoshi Amiibos into the game to activate an ability called “Double Yoshi.” This creates a 2nd Yoshi that aids you during your single-player game!</p>
